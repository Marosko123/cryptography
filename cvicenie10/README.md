# Laboratory Work No. 10

## Task 1
Let a message M be formed in a binary non-redundant code that includes the symbols A1, A2, A3, A4, A5, A6 which are encoded as follows:
- A1 = 00
- A2 = 01
- A3 = 10
- A4 = 11
- A5 = 100
- A6 = 101

Represent the message M in a redundant code, which is formed as follows: one more position in the code symbols is added, and each symbol is determined as the sum of the values of the previous symbols (modulo two).

## Task 2
Using the example of the Huffman table, create your own table with arbitrary numbers. Implement the Huffman algorithm to generate optimal prefix codes based on symbol probabilities.
