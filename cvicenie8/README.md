# Lab 8 - RSA Algorithm

Practical skills in working with the RSA algorithm.

## Tasks

1. Encrypt "Bratislava" using RSA with p=5, q=7 (private key encryption)
2. Encrypt "BANK" using RSA with p=9, q=11 (public key encryption)
3. List all possible public keys for given p and q values

## Run

```bash
python main.py
```

## Implementation

- RSA key generation
- Euler function φ(n) calculation
- Modular inverse using Extended Euclidean Algorithm
- Text encryption/decryption with detailed steps
