Laboratory work No. 4. (part 1)

Purpose of work:
learn to perform
1. operations by modulus.
2. operations for calculating the multiplicative reciprocal
3. form a vector of the remainders of the number by modulus.

Exercise 1. Perform the following operations:
2 mod 4 =
78 mod 33 =
51 mod 7 =
27 mod 47 =
7^-1 mod 47 =
19^-1 mod 7 =
4^-1 mod 7 =
4^-1 mod 15 =
3^-1 mod 7 =
4^-1 mod 17 =
9^-1 mod 17 =
2^-1 mod 6 =

Exercise 2.
2.1. Form the vector of residuals of the number 4 by modulus 9.
2.2. Form the vector of residuals of the number 15 by modulus 7.
2.3. Form the vector of residuals of the number 32 by modulus 29.

Exercise 3.
3.1. Calculate a common secret key in an asymmetric encryption algorithm for a chosen functions:
a) 2^x (mod 4);
b) 78^x (mod 33).
The secret keys for the transmitter and receiver: 6 and 3.

3.2. Answer the question: is it possible to use the function 2^-1 (mod 6) as a common functions and justify your answer.
