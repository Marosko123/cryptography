Lab. Work 3.

Purpose of work (objective):
1. consolidation of practical coding skills;
2. solving of tasks using the XOR operator;
3. obtaining practical skills in solving problems related to the concept of entropy.

Exercise:
1) Encode and decode two messages (a and b) using the Polybius square.
   Message a): ENCRYPT ME 2 DAY
   Message b): your last name.
   
   Also decode the encoded messages to verify correctness.

2) Calculate: a ^ b ^ c ^ a ^ b.
   At:
     a = 1011, b = 0110, c = 0100;
     a = 0101, b = 1110, c = 1101.

3) System X has:
   1) eight states;
   2) 128 states.
   Define entropy (states are equiprobable).

Supporting information (auxiliary info)

Polybius Square.

Polybius' square is a simple substitution cipher. In this example, we will use a 6x6 2D
matrix containing capital letters of the alphabet and numbers from 0 to 9:

      1 2 3 4 5 6
    1 | A B C D E F
    2 | G H I J K L
    3 | M N O P Q R
    4 | S T U V W X
    5 | Y Z 0 1 2 3
    6 | 4 5 6 7 8 9
