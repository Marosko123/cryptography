Laboratory work No. 9. Hash functions

The task 1:
Calculate hash functions for 5 different combinations of n and m for each of the following tasks as
1.1. h(n) = n mod m
1.2. h(n) = (h(n1) + h(n2) + h(n3) + h(n4) + h(n5) + h(n6)) mod m
The values n, n1-n6 and m are chosen from the tables of the initial IP permutation and the final
IP permutation arbitrarily.
Combinations must be calculated for cases when:
A) even n and odd m;
C) odd n and even m.
Write a program that implements the implementation of points 1 and 2.
Record the results in the form of a table.

Task 2:
2.1. Suggest your own algorithm for fast transformation of a string of arbitrary length into a hash
code.

Task 3:
3.1. Implement Schnorr's digital signature algorithm for arbitrary values of p and q.

Schnorr's electronic signature algorithm.
At the first stage, the parameters of the algorithm are selected:
p is a simple number, for real problems its length should be 160 bits < p < 256 bits;
q is a prime number chosen so that it is a divisor of the number p-1);
g is chosen according to a special procedure from Zp, where Zp is the class of residues modulo p;
H – hash function;
x is a random number from the interval [1, q-1]; x – private key of the scheme;
y – public key of the scheme;
Y=g^-x.

After the parameters are selected, the algorithm operations are performed:
1. Participant A chooses a random number k and calculates r=g^k(mod p).
(for this example the number g is chosen arbitrarily)
2. Participant A creates a signature, for this purpose e and s are calculated according to the
formulas
e =H(r,M); s=k+xe.
3. Signature (e,s) and text M are sent to participant B.
4. Participant B verifies the signature by calculating the values of r’ and e’,
r’ = g^s * y^e mod p;
e’ = h(r’,M).
5. The values of e and e’ are compared.

The task 4:
2.1. Write a program that implements items 1,2 and 4,5.
